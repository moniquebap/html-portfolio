<h3>The Haunting of Hill House</h3>
<p>Based on the fascinating book by Shirley Jackson, this puzzling, intriguing, and well-knitted plot
    will put you in the shoes of the Crain family and make you recall the hungry Hill House, 
    a magnificent maze of monsters and memories that will make you scream and jump off the sofa!</p>
<h3>The Boys</h3>
<p>This TV series unveils a dystopian society of superhumans created in a laboratory. 
    They are supposed to be heroes and protect humanity,
    but instead, they are driven by greed, luxury, and vanity like Olympian Gods.</p>
<h3>Lupin</h3>
<p>Inspired by the classic book series The Adventures of Ars√®ne Lupin, 
    our modern thief is a master of disguise who leaves everyone jaw-dropped
